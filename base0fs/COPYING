First and foremost, I reserve the right to relicense any part of the fistgen
package under a different license as I see fit.  The licensing changed over
the lifetime of the FiST project.  See the specific license descriptions
below.

Second, if you use any part of the fistgen code (including the templates and
the generated code), you must include the existing copyright notice which
you can find at the top if each source file, as a C style comment.

As a matter of courtesy, I ask that anyone who uses FiST---commercially or
otherwise---send me a quick note of what they are using it for.  I promise
to keep such information confidential if you ask for discretion.  Knowing
what people do with FiST helps me to justify allocation of grant money,
student effort, and my time for this project.

* fistgen versions newer than 0.1.1

- I added a new .fist file declaration called "license" which takes a
  string.  You must define *some* non-empty license string in your .fist
  file, using this "license" declaration.  It's up to the author to decide
  what they want: it can be anything (open-source, proprietary, etc.).  But
  if on Linux you pick something other than the approved licenses as listed
  in <linux/module.h>, your module may not link into the kernel if it's
  using GPL-only symbols.  This change was made to ensure that users of
  fistgen are fully aware what license they picked for their module on
  Linux.

* fistgen versions 0.0.5 an newer

- I added a special exception similar to the Bison licensing exception made
  by the FSF.  Code GENERATED from the GPL'ed Linux templates may be used
  without restriction.  Note that the templates themselves are still GPL'ed
  and changes to them must be released. See
  http://www.gnu.org/manual/bison-1.35/html_node/Conditions.html#Conditions

* fistgen version 0.0.4.1 and earlier

- The sources for the fistgen tool (not including the templates in the
  fistgen/templates/ subdirectory) are under GPL.

- All Linux templates are under GPL.  All code generated from these
  templates is GPL too.

- All FreeBSD templates are under the BSD license.  All code generated from
  these templates also uses the BSD license.

- All Solaris templates and generated code follow the BSD license.
