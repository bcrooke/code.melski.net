lofs, the Linux LOopback File System
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to be able to make a portion of the file system appear
at another location in the file system tree.  There are a variety of mechanisms
in Linux that attempt to do this, like bind mountpoints, slave mountpoints,
and mount namespaces.  None of these are acceptable for my needs, for one 
reason or another.

This module is a Linux version of the Solaris filesystem of the same name.  Its
chief contribution is the ability to mirror a portion of the file system,
*including submounts*, to another location in the filesystem.  For example,
given a filesystem like this:

/		ext2fs
+ net		autofs
  + tools	nfs

Mounting lofs like this:

    mount -t lofs -o dir=/ / /lofs

Will make the following paths accessible, in addition to anything on the
/ filesystem itself:

    /lofs/net
    /lofs/net/tools
