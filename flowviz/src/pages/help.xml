    <h1>Flowviz Plugin</h1>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    The Flowviz plugin enables you to visualize the execution of a workflow
    run by ElectricCommander.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    After installing the Flowviz plugin, you must create a view (or extend
    an existing view) to expose the "Flowviz" tab.  The view definition must
    contain the following XML:

    <pre>
&lt;tab&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Flowviz&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;url&gt;pages/Flowviz-2.0.0/flowviz&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;position&gt;1&lt;/position&gt;
&lt;/tab&gt;
</pre>

    You will also need to install 
    <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>, a free graphing toolkit 
    available for Windows and Linux.

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      To use the Flowviz plugin, select the "Flowviz" tab.  You will be shown a
      simple form which you may use to specify either an active workflow or
      a workflow definition.  Enter the required information and click the
      "Show workflow" button.
    </p><p>
      After a few seconds, you will see a visualization of the specified
      workflow or workflow definition.  States are shown as boxes; transitions
      are the arrows between boxes.
    </p><p>
      When viewing an active workflow, the currently active state will be
      highlighted in red, and any available manual transitions from that state
      will be highlighted as well.  To advance the workflow, you may click on
      any available transition.
    </p><p>
      When viewing a workflow definition, you may create new states by clicking
      the "Create State Definition" link.  You can create new transitions by
      first clicking on a state in the graph to go to the "State Definition
      Detail" page, and from there adding a new transition.
